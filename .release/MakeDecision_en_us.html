<br />
<p>The Make decision app illustrates a <strong>non-linear method for analyzing hierarchies</strong>. The method involves comparing some
objects, phenomena or outcomes of events based on a set of criteria and the choice of the most “correct” of them, i.e. that one,
which will have the highest score. The user is prompted to select elements and criteria
for their comparison, as well as to evaluate the significance of each criterion and the “cost” of the element for each criterion.
Based on this information, the program receives a result.</p>
